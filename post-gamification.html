      What keeps users coming back to Brain Gym every day? The answer lies in gamification.
      By turning mental fitness into a rewarding game, Brain Gym encourages users to stay consistent and engaged without feeling like they’re doing boring "work".

    <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
      With features like daily streaks, XP points, achievement badges, and progress tracking graphs, users are motivated by both intrinsic satisfaction and external rewards.
      Each completed challenge unlocks a sense of progress, much like leveling up in your favorite video game.

      Gamification is not just fun — it’s psychologically backed to enhance habit formation, improve consistency, and reduce cognitive fatigue. That’s why Brain Gym incorporates these elements so deeply into its design.
